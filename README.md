## Project Overview
Citibike needs to convince investors to begin a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. I have been asked to create visualizations for a bike trip analysis in order to conclude whether this would be a solid business venture. In this analysis, I have analyzed NYC data and created a set of visualizations that:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
I created a total of seven visualizations. Two of which are line charts that show trends in checkout times of the Citibikes and gender of customers.

Then there are heatmap visualizations to help investors see how bike-sharing differs by days of the week, gender, and customer type (whether they are subscriber to the Citbike ride-sharing program or not).

Finally, there is a symbol map to geographically depict where rides begin, and a pie chart that breaks down gender of user.

## Summary
The following is the summary and results of the each individual visualization in the Tableau story:

1. The first line chart shows the length of time bikes are checked out for in hours and minutes. It shows that over 140,000 bikes were checked out for up to 2 hours in August of 2019.
2. The second line chart again shows the length of time bikes are checked out, but this time it shows how this differs amongst genders. Men typically check out Citibikes for longer durations of time.
3. The first heatmap in the story helps to visualize which days of the week and at what times bikes are utilized by customers. Bikes were more often used in the evenings between 5PM and 8PM, and they were more popular on weekend afternoons than on weekday afternoons.
4. The next heatmap shows that bikes are more popular amongst male customers any day of the week.
5. The final heatmap helps visualize what type of customer base more frequently checked out bikes - customers or subscribers. Subscribers checked out bikes more often than the non-subscribing customer, male subscribers checked out bikes more often than female subscribers, and bikes were most frequently utilized on Thursdays by the male subscribers.
6. The symbol map shows that most rides start in lower Manhattan. This may indicate to investors that Citibikes are most profitable in areas with more tourist which may be helpful when deciding where to place Citibike checkout locations in Des Moines, Iowa.
7. The last visualization is a pie chart that depicts the gender breakdown of NYC's Citibike customer base in August of 2019. Over half of the customers in August 2019 identify as male. This can be helpful in marketing efforts.
